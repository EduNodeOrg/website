Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing the application state.
React Router: A powerful library for handling navigation and routing within a React application.
React Cookie Consent: A simple and customizable cookie consent bar for React applications.
The application uses React Router for handling various routes and rendering the appropriate components, such as Login, Register, Dashboard, Settings, and other custom components. It also utilizes Redux to manage the application state and connect components to the Redux store.

In addition, the application features a wide range of custom-built components, such as Home, AboutUs, ContactUs, Resources, Community, Blog, and more. These components cover various aspects of the application, providing users with an immersive and interactive learning experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
